# starbucks_exercise

Take-home Data Science exercise for Starbucks applicants, provided in the [Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) course.

## Introduction

The task is to analyze an A/B test of a promotion with customers which got sent a promotional offer to buy a product and a control group which did not receive the promotion.

The first task is to analyze whether the experiment had a significant impact on purchasing behaviour and to compute the incremental response rate (IRR) and net incremental revenue (NIR). The second task is to build a model to select the best customers to target in order to further increase NIR and IRR based on customer data containing 7 features.

Further details and my results can be found in the main jupyter notebook: `Starbucks.ipynb`.

## Recommended software stack

I recommend to use an up-to-date `python` data science software stack to run the notebook. In particular, the following packages must be available:

- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- catboost

And that's it! I hope you find this exercise interesting. Feel free to explore beyond what I did. Also, feel free to reach out if you are experiencing any bugs or have questions about the current code. Happy coding!
